  caption: Microfluidic, laminar flow chamber (lower right). Fluids flow from the
    top two reservoirs, combine, and mix by diffusion as they flow along the center
    channel. The upper left image is a magnified view showing diffusion where the
    two fluids meet. (Image courtesy of Carlos Dorta-Quinones and Noel Reyes-Gonzalez.
