description: Microfluidic, laminar flow chamber (lower right). Fluids flow from the
  top two reservoirs, combine, and mix by diffusion as they flow along the center
  channel. The upper left image is a magnified view showing diffusion where the two
  fluids meet. (Image courtesy of Carlos Dorta-Quinones and Noel Reyes-Gonzalez. Used
